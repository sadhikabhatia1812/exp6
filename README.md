-> Experiment Title: FOR AND WHILE LOOPS IN C++

-> Objective:
To understand and implement the use of for and while loops in C++

-> Apparatus Required:
Computer system with C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Turbo C++)

-> Description of the Experiment:
This experiment involves writing multiple C++ programs using for and while loops to generate various patterns. Each pattern demonstrates a different use case of nested looping, conditional logic, and iteration control. The programs include:

1. Right-Angled Triangle Star Pattern:
A simple increasing pattern where each row contains an increasing number of stars. This pattern is ideal for understanding nested for loops and row-column-based logic.

2. Mirror Image of Right-Angled Triangle:
This pattern shifts the stars to the right by adding leading spaces. It helps demonstrate how to manipulate output formatting using spacing and nested loop control.

3. Upside-Down Right-Angled Triangle:
A decreasing pattern where each row has fewer stars than the previous one. This shows how loop counters can be reversed and how conditions can be structured for decreasing outputs.

4. Equilateral Triangle (Proper Triangle):
This is a centered triangle pattern with increasing stars and decreasing spaces, giving a symmetrical pyramid shape. It’s useful for mastering the concept of balancing two nested loops — one for spaces and one for stars.

5. Floyd’s Triangle:
A number-based triangle where numbers are printed in a continuous sequence row-wise. This pattern is great for understanding increment operations and combining numerical logic with looping constructs.

-> Learning Outcomes:
Understanding the structure and flow of for and while loops.
Learning how nested loops function in C++.
Gaining hands-on experience in output formatting.
Applying loop constructs to solve pattern-based problems.
Enhancing logical thinking and control flow comprehension through practical code implementation.
